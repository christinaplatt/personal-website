		Hello world, the Journey from Wawa manager, to Bank Teller, to Web Developer
	</h2>
	<p>For nine years, I worked for Wawa. What can i say, I loved it. I loved the people, both customers and employees. I never complained(much) about working late or pulling doubles, but after nine years I decided to make a change! A position opened up at a local bank, and I decided to go for it! I was excited to work in a professional enviroment and learn new and different things. After a few months I decided that I wanted more of a challenge.</p>
	<p>
		I decided to be a Web Developer. In my Time at NYCDA, I have learned  HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. I think the most important discovery I have made while in bootcamp, is that I enjoy learning to code! Learning new languages and discovering new aspects of languages I am familiar with is exciting and fun!
